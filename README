Welcome to Degrees If You Please

I spent way too long searching the web for a quick way to convert a list of latitude/longitude values in decimal degree format to UTM 13 (datum NAD 83) format. If that last sentence didn't make your head spin you are in the right place :)

With this python script all you have to do is add the CSV(s) and click "Convert". You will be asked where you want to save your newly converted file.

User Options:
1. Select the columns that contain the latitude and longitude values in decimal degree format.
2. Whether the first row in the first file contains headings that we wish to skip over.
3. Option to remove the first row (which usually contains the headings) from every subsequent file.
4. Depending on your situation you may need to ignore the math and always keep the Zone at 13U during the conversion.

If the majority of this code looks familiar it's because most of the user interface is borrowed from my CommaCombine program also hosted here on github.

Note: For all you math geeks out there the calculations take place between lines 136 and 195 :)

Enjoy!
